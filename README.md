# Data Cleaning with Pandas

This is a simple exercise demonstrating basic data cleaning using Python and Pandas.  
The notebook `basic_cleaning.ipynb` walks through cleaning a sample dataset to make it ready for analysis.

## Project Overview

In this exercise, I worked on a dataset containing customer information. The main steps include:

- Handling missing values  
- Cleaning and formatting columns such as `Phone_Number` and `Last_Name`  
- Splitting the `Address` column into `Street Address`, `State`, and `Zip_Code`  
- Removing unnecessary characters from string columns  
- Preparing the dataset for further analysis
